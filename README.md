Hello World!

I have a CS degree, was a Java dev for about a year. 
I got bored with my job and decided, quite hastily, that programming wasn't for me.
In hindsight, I probably would have enjoyed programming in a different job environment. 

So here I am, after a 5 year hiatus, ready to program as a hobby.
Who knows...if I get really good and enjoy what I'm doing, I may decide to back to coding for money!
